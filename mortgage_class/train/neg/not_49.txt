  (a)  Finding by Board.  Upon the affirmative vote of at least five members of the Board and after consultation with the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and the National Credit Union Administration Board, the Board may impose a supplemental reserve requirement on every depository institution of not more than 4 percent of its total transaction accounts. A supplemental reserve requirement may be imposed if:  (1)  The sole purpose of the requirement is to increase the amount of reserves maintained to a level essential for the conduct of monetary policy;  (2)  The requirement is not imposed for the purpose of reducing the cost burdens resulting from the imposition of basic reserve requirements;  (3)  Such requirement is not imposed for the purpose of increasing the amount of balances needed for clearing purposes; and    (4)  On the date on which supplemental reserve requirements are imposed, the total amount of basic reserve requirements is not less than the amount of reserves that would berequired on transaction accounts and nonpersonal time deposits under the initial reserve ratios established by the Monetary Control Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-221) in effect on September 1, 1980.
